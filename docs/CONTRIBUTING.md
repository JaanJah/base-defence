# Contributing

We are glad to see that you want to help out this project!

Before you start making your contribution, please follow these rules:

- Please follow the issue template when creating an issue.
- Write descriptive commit messages and keep the commit history clean! Read how to write a good commit [here!](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
- Pull Request (PR) title should be the solution to the problem, so it's easy to understand what it does! PR body should explain how to solve the problem, if the PR is a fix for an issue, please leave a link to the issue too!
- If you submit a PR, but it's still in progress, add `WIP` to the title of PR so others know.
